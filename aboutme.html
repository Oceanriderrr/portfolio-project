                <p>Hi, my name is Mike and I live in Honolulu where it is easy to access many of my favorite hobbies. I had my first experience with coding while working for a website that sold reservations for vacation activities. I first started in the customer service role before moving into sales where I had had more reponsibility in creating product listings on the website. I am interested in learning how to make e-commerce websites work more efficiently for a better customer experience and better user experience for the employees of the business.</p>
